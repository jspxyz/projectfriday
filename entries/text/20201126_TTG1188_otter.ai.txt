Is day 1188. It's Thursday November 26 2020 at 1957, or 8:57pm, wait and wait. 17 almost eight o'clock, it's almost a pm I

feel pretty down today. Bitcoin was way down. Like it felt like it was crashing or go down forever. I approached approach has been that it's always going to go up higher so I should buy a little bit at a time so I had triggers last night, for the first time that light actually hit. Put it dropped further and further, so I sold out $1,000 worth today, which is not that much. So I, you know, I lost most of my gains pretty sad. But it's okay I guess the lesson I didn't learn, lose everything so that's fine I still have some left mitts hovering right around 17,000, but I talk to Charles Oh my project idea and he just kind of destroyed it. It said that I have no basis for what I'm doing. Pretty, maybe pretty bad with Bitcoin and just not feeling well lately just made me feel really shitty. Having worked on my project at all this week actually not I think about it, I've done nothing, and it's bad. And now it's almost the weekend and yeah so I'm gonna take again one night off tomorrow, and then work all day Saturday. All day Sunday, that's going to have to do it. So, yeah, not feeling great about everything right now. Yeah, okay. That's it. Goodnight.
